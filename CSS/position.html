/*
  CSS Position Property Explained:

  1. static:
     - Default position.
     - Box sits in normal flow.
     - Analogy: A box sitting normally on a table.

  2. relative:
     - Box stays in flow but can be nudged using top/left/right/bottom.
     - Other elements still consider original space.
     - Analogy: Slide the box a little on the table, but the table remembers its spot.

  3. absolute:
     - Box is removed from normal flow.
     - Positioned relative to nearest ancestor with a position (not static).
     - Analogy: Pick up the box and place it anywhere inside a room; other boxes ignore it.

  4. fixed:
     - Box is removed from flow and positioned relative to the viewport.
     - Stays in place even when scrolling.
     - Analogy: Tape the box to the screen; it stays visible always.

  5. sticky:
     - Box acts like relative until a scroll point, then sticks like fixed.
     - Analogy: Slide the box along with the page, then stick it at a certain point.

  Key: Use position property + top/left/right/bottom to control placement.
